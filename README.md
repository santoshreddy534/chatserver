Final project for IFT 510 Princ of Comp & Info Tech Arch (ASU)

Developed a fully functional Chat Server using the TCP protocol.
Utilized multithreading to run multiple clients where each client is considered as a
single thread. TCP socket is used to implement the network connection and communication.
We have one server, and it should be run first before the clients attempt to connect to the
server. The clients must connect to the server using the serverâ€™s IP address and port number.
Upon successful connection to the server, the clients can communicate with each other. The
clients have features like broadcasting their messages to all connected users, direct message
to the specific user connected to the server, requesting the list of users connected to the
server, request help to server to know the usage and descriptions of the commands, and quit
the server. These features can be utilized by using the specific commands
